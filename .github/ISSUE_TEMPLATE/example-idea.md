Problem:

- Traditional exoskeleton devices or recent EEG devices use invasive techniques for operation.
**Invasive** here means that the hardware is inserted inside or on the human body, which can result in various health issues such as foreign body reflex, infection, etc.

Solution:

- Use BCI with Context Aware AI trained on signals provided by EEG.
- This will allow crippled or disabled patients to perform normal activities such as standing up, walking, grabbing, throwing, etc.
