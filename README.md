# VEGG and Vicharak Idea Sessions Archive Repository

Idea Sessions repository for [VEGG](https://vegg.co.in) & [Vicharak](https://vicharak.in).
We discuss ideas every month that are presented.

This repository will track all the idea sessions conducted at the office. It will contain each **individual's** idea along with an explanation and relevant resources.

The format for submitting an individual's idea will be through comments on an issue created during the week of the idea session.

To submit your idea, comment on the issue with the following format:

1. Author and Title of Idea:
    - Name the Author and describe your idea in a title of less than 100 words.
